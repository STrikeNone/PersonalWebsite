      "This module was essentially a module focused on imparting to us writing skills that would be useful to us in the future when drafting reports. The assesment components were broken down into 3 parts (and Group participation), Annotated Biblography (Individual), Review Paper (Group) and Oral Presentation. Students were asked to write an Annotated Bilography on one of two articles utilising writing skills taught throughout the semster. Learning to read the text critically and forming proper arguments were essential to writing a good essay. The group portion involved partnering another person who chose a different article to evaluate both articles together as a Review Paper. From my experience, I think good communication between your groupmate will help in deciding better on what to write (Something i did not do as well in). I had asked my fellow friends to constructively criticise my work in order to find loop holes to improve on. Subsequently, the Oral portion required us to choose any topic on Science and to present on it. Being an avid fan of cyber security and having done my OP in JC on it, i chose the same topic (Defending against Cyber Security in the 21st Century). \n \n Having struggled in General Paper back in JC, I personally found this module to be harder as I often struggled with writing formal, yet solid evaluations. In terms of hours spent on this module, while there is no fixed timing, i'd personally say i dedicated about 3-4 hours a week for this module trying to look at my writing to improve on it.",

      "This module focused on teaching discrete concepts (obviously) of mathematics such as relations, propositional logic, predicate logic, induction, set theory, graph theory etc. I felt that most of the things in this module required alot of logical thinking and common sense. CA1 and CA2 both had a bonus question that was insanely hard to solve. I managed to find online resources from other universities online that talked about certain tricky relation problems which ended up being tested. Overall, this module was moderate in terms of difficulty, and with sufficient practice of finals paper, anyone should be able to excel in it. Prof Yi Li was one of the best professors in explaining the concepts to us. \n \n I was really lucky because 3 times i managed to predict the EXACT question that came out, either from random online resources/friends casually asking me for help.",

      "Hands down the hardest module in Y1S1. This module focused on looking back to JC calculus but on a deeper level. Limits and Continuity was one of the most complicated concepts for me as it involved using the epsilon-delta definition. These concepts were then extended to differentiaton and then to Integration and finally Differential Equation. We were also briefly introduced to Big O notation. The tutorials were much harder than the Mid Terms and Finals. In order to not lag behind, i spent alot of attention focusing on the early concepts taught to us and searched for practice questions in our tutorials and redoing them. Tutorials were mostly in group discussion of the tutorial works. We also had a graded IRA (Individual Readiness Assesment) and TRA (Team..) every 2-3 weeks. We would first do a quiz individually and then discuss as a group and resubmit our answers. Being able to bank our scores on multiple options was certainly risky, but i remember telling my group to be confident and go all in with the points (HAHA). The group assigned to us were also important as we were given a coding assignment once every few weeks where we had to implement the concpets taught to us in code, to solve a problem. With about 2 week it was more than sufficient time to complete the assignment. Really enjoyed the group assignment as it also gave me a chance to know my course mates better from just talking things outside of work :) \n \n Mathematically inclined students will certainly enjoy this module regardless of how hard it is. The concepts are also vital to Data Science as i realised when diving deeper into Neural Networks. Blackpenredpen became my favourite youtuber for saving my life countless number of times :)",

      "This module was our basic introduction module to programming. Consisting of two portions, Python and C. The Python portion introduced us to various python concepts and structures such as list, dictionaries, loops, recursion and labs involved us applying these concepts to the Raspberry Pi (sort of a mini computer). We were asked to create games which was quite enjoyable. Mid Terms had 2 test, a Python MCQ quiz on lab and tutorial concepts each having equal weightage. Being an MCQ test it was quite doable as we could guess answers even if we didnt knew how to do (I guessed so many rip). \n \n The C portion (Week 7 - 12) involved introducing to us the basic concepts of C as well an Structs! C was certainly much harder than Python as it isnt as user-friendly. Having picked up Python a few weeks before Uni started, i struggled alot in the C portion and constantly redid the questions they had in an online server. The best way to learn programming in my opinion is through doing problems. The weekly assignments certainly helped us alot with that. During finals, some questions were repeated from our assignment and different students got different questions. I was quite lucky that 2/5 of my questions were repeated once. The zoom session with my clique before finals also attributed to me remembering what to do with the questions on strings :). Overall i would say this module is average in difficulty as it served as an introductory course. The lecutrers for Python were solid but for C it was extremely dry",

      "This module was a continuation from MH1805 Calculus where we learned more about Multivariable Calculus. A nice way to simplify would be Calculus but in vector form. Differentiation and Integration techniques (Greens Theorem, Divergence Theorem, Stokes Theorem) were taught to us. With sufficient practice on the Tutorials it was sufficient to do well in the Mid terms. During Finals, they set the last question to be a tricky one which required higher thinking. I was unable to think clearly and couldnt solve the entire 15m last question (Not to mention realising at the last second that the double integration boundary i wrote for another qn was wrong). While the results were disappointing, I personally found this mod to be the most enjoyable and easiest throughout the semester",

But the mid terms and finals set were definitely doable. Questions were reused from the tutorial and the course text book (Practise that and you should be fine).

Chaptrer 1 being mostly about MH2500 concepts with more in-depth knowledge into MGFs and Chi-Square/Gamma/t-distributions. Chapter 2 would be the hardest with most of the content revolving around Estimators (MLE, MME, Pivotal Quantitys, Asymptotic). Chapter 3 is just Hypothesis testing. I would highly recommend doing this module concurrently with MH3511 as it saves you alot of studying time since there are multiple overlapping topics. There is alo a weekly graded quiz but it is generally doable and only 4/8 is required per quiz to obtain the full score.",
